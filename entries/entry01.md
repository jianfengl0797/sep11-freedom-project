# Entry 1

For my freedom project this year, I have decided on the topic of Metallurgical Engineering. This topic focused on the understanding of metals and how they interact with the environment. At first, I wasn't sure which topic to focus, but I looked over the engineering section since it's very important in the future and realized that Metallurgical Engineering seems to grasp my interest. There are other feilds that catched my focus like Chemical Engineering or Environmental Engineering. However, Metallurgical Engineering is a more specific topic that connects to these two, thats why I decided to dedicate my freedom project to Metallurgical Engineering.
