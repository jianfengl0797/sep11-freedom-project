# Entry 1

  For my freedom project this year, I have decided on the topic of Metallurgical Engineering. This topic focused on the understanding of metals and how they interact with the environment. At first, I wasn't sure which topic to focus, but I looked over the engineering section since it's very important in the future and realized that Metallurgical Engineering seems to grasp my interest. 

  Since middle school, I have been interested in learning more about science, but has been told many times that science is a very broad topic so I need to be more specific. I am also interested in engineering because it's very useful in improving our future in a positive way. The crowd sourcing of the many career topics in my SEP class proved to be extremely helpful. I narrowed down some of the positive science engineering options and came to the conclusion of Metallurgical Engineering. The reason why I prefer this over other topics is because I don't really enjoy making predictions through technology screen all the time. There are other feilds that catched my focus like Chemical Engineering or Environmental Engineering. However, Metallurgical Engineering is a more specific topic that connects to these two, thats why I decided to dedicate my freedom project to Metallurgical Engineering. With Metallurgical Engineering, I observe things visually and maybe create better products in the future. This is why I am interested in learning about Metallugical Engineering, at least this is my taste currently.
